        <h2>Coach assessment & plan</h2>
        <div>1) Current fitness level – strengths & weaknesses<br>
<br>
Overall:  <br>
- Age 35, solid running background (3:23 marathon, 1:31 half) and a lot of recent cycling volume.  <br>
- You’re aerobically decent already and can handle long sessions, especially on the bike.  <br>
- Training time: 8–10 h/week is good for a strong age‑group 70.3 performance if used well.<br>
<br>
Running  <br>
- Recent runs (Oct–Nov) are mostly 6–18 km at ~4:40–5:10/km with average HR ~155–166.  <br>
- That’s “moderate/hard” for you, not easy. Very little truly easy Z1–Z2 running.  <br>
- Long runs: several 18–28–42 km runs in the last 2 months – good durability, but many are too fast for long‑run HR.  <br>
- Strengths:  <br>
  - Proven endurance (marathon PB and recent long runs).  <br>
  - Comfortable with frequent running (3–5x/week at times).  <br>
- Weaknesses:  <br>
  - Lack of polarized distribution: too much “grey zone” (tempo-ish) instead of mostly easy + some quality.  <br>
  - 10K speed relative to HM/marathon suggests limited top‑end and threshold work; you’re more diesel than sharp.  <br>
  - Risk: running most days at moderate intensity can stall progress and increase injury risk when we add more structure.<br>
<br>
Cycling  <br>
- Very strong recent volume: many 50–90 km rides, plus frequent 30–60 km MyWhoosh sessions.  <br>
- HR on many virtual rides (when recorded) is low: avg 118–136 bpm for 60–90 min, which is solid aerobic Z2 for you.  <br>
- You’ve done multiple 2.5–4 h rides outdoors with decent elevation – good durability.  <br>
- Strengths:  <br>
  - Bike endurance is already ahead of your run and swim.  <br>
  - You tolerate frequent riding and long sessions well.  <br>
- Weaknesses:  <br>
  - Almost no structured intervals (no clear tempo/threshold/VO2 blocks).  <br>
  - Limited HR data on many rides, and no power info – hard to quantify intensity precisely.  <br>
  - For a 4:30 70.3, you’ll need a strong, specific FTP and ability to ride ~2:20–2:25 at controlled power.<br>
<br>
Swimming  <br>
- Very little consistent, measurable swim work. Distances are often 0–50 m logged, or a single 706 m session.  <br>
- This is currently the biggest limiter for a competitive 70.3.  <br>
- Strengths:  <br>
  - You’re at least getting in the water occasionally; HR is low, so you’re not overreaching.  <br>
- Weaknesses:  <br>
  - No real swim volume or structure.  <br>
  - Technique and endurance are unknown but likely underdeveloped relative to your run/bike.<br>
<br>
General  <br>
- You handle 8–12+ hour weeks already (counting long rides and long runs).  <br>
- Intensity distribution is skewed: running too hard, cycling mostly easy, swimming almost absent.  <br>
- No major injuries – good, but current pattern (lots of moderate running + long runs) could become risky when we add speed.<br>
<br>
2) Goal realism<br>
<br>
Main goal: 70.3 in 4:30 on 2026‑05‑24  <br>
- Time horizon: ~18 months – excellent.  <br>
- Rough splits for 4:30 (depending on course):  <br>
  - Swim: ~30–32 min  <br>
  - Bike: ~2:20–2:25  <br>
  - Run: ~1:30–1:32  <br>
  - Transitions: ~5–8 min total  <br>
- Based on your current run PBs, a 1:30 half‑marathon off the bike is ambitious but realistic with focused training.  <br>
- Bike: with your current volume, a 2:20–2:25 is realistic if we build structured intensity and race‑specific work.  <br>
- Swim: biggest gap; you need to get to ~2:00/100m pace for 1.9 km with comfort. That’s very achievable in 18 months with 3x/week consistent swimming.  <br>
→ Assessment: 4:30 is ambitious but realistic if:<br>
  - You commit to consistent swimming (3x/week most weeks).  <br>
  - We shift your run to more polarized training and protect you from injury.  <br>
  - We add structured bike intervals and race‑specific work.  <br>
  - You maintain ~8–10 h/week with some 10–12 h peak weeks.<br>
<br>
Secondary goal: 10K sub‑40 by 2026‑01‑11  <br>
- Time horizon: ~1.5 months from now.  <br>
- Current PB: 41:49.  <br>
- Recent training: a lot of volume, but little targeted 10K speed/threshold work; also many runs are already moderately hard.  <br>
- To go from 41:49 → sub‑40 (~4:11/km → 3:59/km) you need ~3–4% improvement in ~6 weeks. That’s tough but not impossible if you’re already close to that fitness.  <br>
- However, we also want to protect the long‑term 70.3 goal and avoid injury.  <br>
→ Assessment:  <br>
  - Sub‑40 by that exact date is borderline/low‑probability without a very focused 6–8 week 10K block and some luck.  <br>
  - More realistic:  <br>
    - Aim for a strong 10K (maybe 40:30–41:00) on that date,  <br>
    - Then target sub‑40 later in 2026 as part of your 70.3 build when your threshold improves.<br>
<br>
3) High‑level periodization until 2026‑05‑24<br>
<br>
We’ll treat now as late 2025 and plan to race in May 2026.<br>
<br>
Macro‑phases:<br>
1. Base 1 (Nov 2025 – Feb 2026) – ~16 weeks  <br>
2. Build 1 (Mar – mid‑May 2026) – ~10 weeks  <br>
3. Peak (late May 2026) – ~2 weeks  <br>
4. Taper (final 10–14 days pre‑race – overlaps with Peak)<br>
<br>
Because the race is still far, we can also think in two macro‑cycles:<br>
- Cycle A: Now → Jan 2026: 10K focus + general tri base, heavy on swim and aerobic work.  <br>
- Cycle B: Feb → May 2026: 70.3‑specific build, peak, taper.<br>
<br>
Detailed outline:<br>
<br>
Phase 1: Base 1 / General Prep (Now – end Feb 2026, ~16 weeks)  <br>
Primary aims:<br>
- Establish consistent triathlon routine: 3x swim, 3–4x bike, 3–4x run per week.  <br>
- Fix intensity distribution: 80–90% of sessions easy, 10–20% quality.  <br>
- Build swim volume and technique.  <br>
- Maintain and slightly sharpen run for the 10K attempt without overdoing intensity.  <br>
- Build bike aerobic base and some low‑intensity strength (hills/big gear).<br>
<br>
Key elements:<br>
- Running:  <br>
  - 1 quality session/week (alternating: tempo/threshold intervals, short hill reps).  <br>
  - 1 long run (easy, HR clearly lower than current – think conversational).  <br>
  - 1–2 easy runs (shorter, pure Z1–Z2).  <br>
- Cycling:  <br>
  - 2–3 aerobic rides (60–120 min, mostly Z2).  <br>
  - 1 light interval session (e.g., sweet spot/tempo blocks) every 1–2 weeks.  <br>
- Swimming:  <br>
  - Start with 2x/week, progress to 3x/week.  <br>
  - Focus on drills + short intervals (e.g., 25–100m repeats) to build technique and comfort.  <br>
- Strength:  <br>
  - 1–2x/week short functional strength/core (can be adapted from your CrossFit background but controlled, not maximal).<br>
<br>
Within this phase:<br>
- Early (Nov–Dec): emphasize technique, easy volume, and getting used to 3‑sport weeks.  <br>
- Dec–Jan: add more structured run intervals to give you a shot at a 10K PB.  <br>
- After 10K race (mid‑Jan): shift emphasis from pure run speed to tri‑specific durability and swim/bike volume.<br>
<br>
Phase 2: Build 1 / 70.3‑specific (Mar – mid‑May 2026, ~10 weeks)  <br>
Primary aims:<br>
- Increase race‑specific intensity and brick work.  <br>
- Solidify swim endurance at race pace.  <br>
- Raise bike FTP and ability to ride long at ~70–80% of FTP.  <br>
- Improve run off the bike (bricks, tempo runs).<br>
<br>
Key elements:<br>
- Running:  <br>
  - 1 threshold/tempo session per week (e.g., 3×10 min @ ~HM pace, or 5–8 km continuous tempo).  <br>
  - 1 long run (up to 20–24 km, mostly easy, occasional last 5–8 km at 70.3 pace).  <br>
  - 1 short brick run off the bike (20–40 min at 70.3 run pace) most weeks.  <br>
- Cycling:  <br>
  - 1–2 quality sessions/week:  <br>
    - e.g., 3×15–20 min @ sweet spot / low threshold,  <br>
    - or 4×8–10 min @ threshold.  <br>
  - 1 long ride (2.5–3.5 h) with extended blocks at 70.3 power/effort.  <br>
  - Some bricks with race‑pace segments.  <br>
- Swimming:  <br>
  - 3x/week:  <br>
    - 1 technique + drills,  <br>
    - 1 threshold/VO2 (e.g., 10×100m @ strong but sustainable),  <br>
    - 1 endurance (e.g., 4×400m or 3×600m at steady pace).  <br>
<br>
Phase 3: Peak (late May 2026, ~2 weeks)  <br>
Primary aims:<br>
- Sharpen race‑specific intensity.  <br>
- Maintain volume but slightly reduced, with more rest.  <br>
- Practice race nutrition and pacing in a few key sessions.<br>
<br>
Key elements:<br>
- 1–2 key brick workouts simulating race intensity but shorter (e.g., 2 h bike with 3×20 min at race effort + 8–10 km run at race pace).  <br>
- Swim sets with longer continuous efforts at race pace (e.g., 1×1500m steady).  <br>
- Overall volume down ~20–30% from peak, but intensity maintained.<br>
<br>
Phase 4: Taper (last 10–14 days pre‑race)  <br>
Primary aims:<br>
- Arrive fresh, not flat.  <br>
- Maintain feel for race pace in all three sports.  <br>
<br>
Key elements:<br>
- Reduce volume to ~40–60% of peak by race week.  <br>
- Short, sharp efforts at race pace in all disciplines.  <br>
- Extra sleep, dialed nutrition, no new stressors.<br>
<br>
4) Weekly focus & approximate hours per phase<br>
<br>
Given your 8–10 h/week availability, we’ll keep most weeks in that band, with a few 10–11 h peaks.<br>
<br>
Phase 1: Base 1 / General Prep (Now – end Feb 2026)<br>
<br>
Typical week: 8–9 h  <br>
- Swim: 2–3x (total 1.5–2.5 h)  <br>
- Bike: 3x (total 3–4 h)  <br>
- Run: 3–4x (total 3–3.5 h)  <br>
- Strength: 1–2x short (0.5–1 h, often overlapping with other sessions)<br>
<br>
Weekly focus:<br>
- 70–80% of training easy.  <br>
- Build consistent swim habit and gradually reach ~5–6 km/week.  <br>
- Run: keep one quality session + one long run, but slow down most other runs.  <br>
- Bike: maintain your strong volume but introduce one structured interval session every 1–2 weeks.<br>
<br>
Phase 2: Build 1 / 70.3‑specific (Mar – mid‑May 2026)<br>
<br>
Typical week: 9–10.5 h (some peak weeks up to ~11 h)  <br>
- Swim: 3x (2–3 h, ~6–7 km/week).  <br>
- Bike: 3–4x (4–5 h, including one long ride and one interval session).  <br>
- Run: 3–4x (3–3.5 h, including one tempo/threshold, one long, one brick).  <br>
- Strength: 1x 30–40 min maintenance.<br>
<br>
Weekly focus:<br>
- 1–2 key sessions per sport each week; everything else supports recovery.  <br>
- Regular bricks to condition your legs to running off the bike.  <br>
- Practice race nutrition on long rides and long bricks.<br>
<br>
Phase 3: Peak (late May 2026, ~2 weeks)<br>
<br>
Typical week: 7–8 h  <br>
- Slightly reduced volume but maintain intensity.  <br>
- 1–2 key race‑specific bricks and one key swim set per week.  <br>
- More rest days or very light days.<br>
<br>
Phase 4: Taper (final 10–14 days)<br>
<br>
Race week: 5–6 h  <br>
- Short, specific sessions in all three sports.  <br>
- No heavy strength work.  <br>
- Focus on feeling sharp and rested.<br>
<br>
If you’d like, next step I can:  <br>
- Sketch a sample “Base 1” week tailored to your current pattern (including exact paces/HR zones), and  <br>
- Outline a 6‑week mini‑plan leading into your 10K race that balances the sub‑40 attempt with long‑term 70.3 prep.</div>
