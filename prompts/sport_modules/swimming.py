# SWIMMING-SPECIFIC TRAINING GUIDE

## TRAINING ZONES FOR SWIMMING

### Method: Critical Swim Speed (CSS)
**Most accurate method for swimming zones**

**Step 1: Test CSS**
- Swim 400m time trial (all-out effort)
- Rest 20 minutes
- Swim 200m time trial (all-out effort)

**Step 2: Calculate CSS**
CSS = 200 / (T400 - T200)

Where:
T400 = time in seconds for 400m
T200 = time in seconds for 200m

**Example:**
- 400m time: 7:00 (420 seconds)
- 200m time: 3:20 (200 seconds)
- CSS = 200 / (420 - 200) = 200 / 220 = 0.909 m/s
- CSS pace = 1:50 per 100m

**Step 3: Calculate zones from CSS**

Zone 1 (Recovery): CSS + 20-30 seconds per 100m
Zone 2 (Endurance): CSS + 10-15 seconds per 100m
Zone 3 (Tempo): CSS + 5 seconds per 100m
Zone 4 (Threshold): CSS pace exactly
Zone 5 (VO2max): CSS - 5 seconds per 100m
Zone 6 (Speed): CSS - 10+ seconds per 100m

**Example with CSS = 1:50/100m:**
- Zone 1: 2:10-2:20/100m
- Zone 2: 2:00-2:05/100m
- Zone 3: 1:55/100m
- Zone 4: 1:50/100m (CSS)
- Zone 5: 1:45/100m
- Zone 6: <1:40/100m

### Alternative: Heart Rate Based
(Less accurate in water due to horizontal position and cooling)

Zone 1: <65% max HR
Zone 2: 65-75% max HR
Zone 3: 75-82% max HR
Zone 4: 82-89% max HR
Zone 5: 89-95% max HR

**Note:** Subtract 10-13 bpm from land-based max HR for swimming

### RPE Method (Backup)
- Zone 1: RPE 2-3 / Very easy, can breathe every 5+ strokes
- Zone 2: RPE 4-5 / Comfortable, breathing every 3-5 strokes
- Zone 3: RPE 6-7 / Moderate effort, breathing every 3 strokes
- Zone 4: RPE 7-8 / Hard, breathing every 2-3 strokes
- Zone 5: RPE 9 / Very hard, breathing every stroke or bilateral
- Zone 6: RPE 10 / Maximum, any breathing pattern needed

## KEY SWIMMING WORKOUTS

### 1. ENDURANCE SET (Aerobic Base)
**Purpose:** Build aerobic capacity, improve technique efficiency

**Format:**
- Warmup: 400m (200m easy, 8x25m drill/swim)
- Main set: 2000-3000m at Zone 2 (CSS + 10 sec)
- Cooldown: 200m easy
- Total: 2600-3600m, 45-60 minutes

### 2. THRESHOLD SET (CSS Work)
**Purpose:** Improve lactate threshold, race pace endurance

**Classic workouts:**
- 2x(10x100) at CSS, rest 10 sec between reps, 3 min between sets
- 6x400m at CSS pace, rest 45 sec
- Focus: Hold exact CSS pace - use pace clock

### 3. INTERVALS (VO2max)
**Purpose:** Increase maximum aerobic capacity

**Classic workouts:**
- 16x100m at Zone 5 (CSS - 5 sec), rest 20 sec
- Descending ladder: 400-300-200-100m, 3 rounds

### 4. SPEED WORK (Anaerobic)
**Purpose:** Develop pure speed, fast-twitch fibers

**Format:**
- 20x25m sprints at 95-100% effort, rest 30 sec
- 8x(2x25m) with 5 sec rest between, 60 sec between sets

### 5. TECHNIQUE & DRILL WORK
**Purpose:** Improve efficiency, correct flaws, prevent injury

**Essential Drills:**
- Catch-Up Drill: 4x50m (improve extension and timing)
- Fist Drill: 4x50m (feel the water with forearm)
- Single Arm: 4x50m (balance and rotation)
- Fingertip Drag: 4x50m (high elbow recovery)
- Kick on Side: 4x50m (body rotation and streamline)

### 6. OPEN WATER SKILLS
**Purpose:** Prepare for open water swimming (triathlons, OW races)

**Key skills:**
- Sighting drill: Lift head every 6-8 strokes
- Contact/chaos swim: Practice swimming in traffic
- No-wall turns: Simulate buoy turns
- Wave start simulation: Fast first 15m, then settle

## SWIM-SPECIFIC STRENGTH TRAINING

**3x per week, 20-30 minutes**

**Essential exercises:**
1. Lat Pulldowns (3×12) - Pulling power
2. Bent-Over Rows (3×12) - Back strength
3. Push-Ups (3×15) - Shoulder stability
4. Planks (3×60 sec) - Core stability
5. Medicine Ball Rotations (3×20) - Rotational power
6. Band Pull-Aparts (3×20) - Shoulder health

**Shoulder Prehab (Daily):**
- External rotations with band (3×15)
- Y-T-W raises (3×10 each)
- Wall slides (3×10)

## SWIMMING TECHNIQUE ESSENTIALS

### Freestyle Fundamentals
1. **Body Position:** Horizontal, slight downhill (hips higher than feet), head neutral
2. **Catch and Pull:** High elbow catch, pull straight back, EVF (Early Vertical Forearm)
3. **Recovery:** High elbow recovery, enter hand thumb-first
4. **Rotation:** Rotate shoulders 45-60 degrees, hips rotate with shoulders
5. **Kick:** Kick from hips, 2-beat kick for distance, 6-beat for sprints
6. **Breathing:** Bilateral breathing (every 3 strokes), rotate to breathe, don't lift head

### Common Mistakes to Fix
- ❌ Crossing center line on entry
- ❌ Dropping elbow during pull
- ❌ Lifting head to breathe
- ❌ Scissor kick
- ❌ Over-rotation (past 60 degrees)
- ❌ Holding breath underwater

## RACE-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

### Sprint Distance (750m)
- Start: Aggressive first 100m
- Middle: CSS pace, focus on technique
- Finish: All-out last 100m

### Olympic Distance (1500m)
- Start: Controlled but firm first 200m
- Middle: CSS pace, stay relaxed
- Finish: Gradually increase effort last 300m

### Half Ironman (1.9km)
- Start: Conservative first 400m
- Middle: Steady CSS + 5 sec pace
- Finish: Push last 400m if feeling good

### Ironman (3.8km)
- Start: Very controlled first 500m
- Middle: Zone 2 pace (save legs for bike)
- Finish: Maintain steady effort

## TAPER FOR SWIMMING
