# TRIATHLON-SPECIFIC TRAINING GUIDE

## MULTI-SPORT INTEGRATION

Triathlon training combines SWIMMING + CYCLING + RUNNING with special focus on:
1. **Transitions** (T1: Swim-to-Bike, T2: Bike-to-Run)
2. **Brick workouts** (Back-to-back disciplines)
3. **Energy system management** (pacing across 3 sports)
4. **Recovery between disciplines**

**Use individual sport modules for zone calculations:**
- Swimming zones → See SWIMMING MODULE
- Cycling zones → See CYCLING MODULE (FTP-based)
- Running zones → See RUNNING MODULE

## KEY TRIATHLON-SPECIFIC WORKOUTS

### 1. BRICK WORKOUTS (Essential!)
**Purpose:** Adapt to running off the bike with heavy legs

**Classic bricks:**

**A) Olympic Distance Brick**
- Bike: 60 min (45 min Zone 2 + 15 min at race pace Zone 3-4)
- Transition: 2-3 min (practice smooth, quick movements)
- Run: 20 min (first 5 min feel awkward/heavy - normal! Then settle into race pace)
- Focus: Save legs for run, practice race nutrition

**B) Half Ironman Brick**
- Bike: 90 min (60 min Zone 2 + 30 min at Half IM pace Zone 3)
- Transition: 3 min (race-day routine)
- Run: 30-40 min (Zone 2-3, sustainable pace)
- Frequency: 1x per week in build phase

**C) Full Ironman Brick**
- Bike: 180 min (120 min Zone 2 + 60 min at Ironman pace Zone 2-3)
- Transition: 5 min (take time to gather yourself)
- Run: 45-60 min (Zone 2, very controlled)
- Frequency: Every 2-3 weeks in peak phase

### 2. TRANSITION PRACTICE (T1 and T2)
**Purpose:** Save precious seconds, build muscle memory

**T1 Practice (Swim to Bike):**
- Frequency: 1x per week, 6-8 weeks before race
- Wetsuit removal: Pull to waist during swim exit, strip completely while jogging
- Mount/dismount: Practice smooth mount at mount line, controlled dismount
- Time savings: 30-60 seconds with practice

**T2 Practice (Bike to Run):**
- Quick shoe change (elastic laces help)
- Grab hat/race belt efficiently
- After every bike workout, rack bike and run 800m
- Benefit: Adapts legs to running off bike

### 3. RACE SIMULATION WORKOUTS

**Sprint Distance Simulation**
- Swim: 750m at race pace (Zone 4-5)
- T1: 2 min
- Bike: 20K at race watts (Zone 4)
- T2: 1 min
- Run: 5K at race pace (Zone 4)
- When: 6 weeks and 3 weeks before race

**Olympic Distance Simulation**
- Swim: 1500m at race pace (Zone 4)
- T1: 2 min
- Bike: 40K at race watts (Zone 3-4)
- T2: 2 min
- Run: 10K at race pace (Zone 3-4)
- When: 4 weeks before race

## TRIATHLON-SPECIFIC RACE STRATEGIES

### Pacing Guidelines by Distance

**Sprint Distance:**
- Swim: 95% effort (go hard!)
- Bike: 90-95% FTP (aggressive but sustainable)
- Run: 95% effort (almost all-out)

**Olympic Distance:**
- Swim: 85-90% effort (controlled but firm)
- Bike: 85-90% FTP (strong but save legs for run)
- Run: 85-90% threshold pace (hard but controlled)

**Half Ironman (70.3):**
- Swim: 75-80% effort (long day ahead)
- Bike: 70-75% FTP (THE KEY LEG - don't overcook here!)
- Run: 80-85% marathon pace (it will hurt, but sustainable)

**Full Ironman:**
- Swim: 70-75% effort (patience, save energy)
- Bike: 65-70% FTP (CRUCIAL - conservative bike = strong run)
- Run: 75-80% marathon pace (survival mode, stay steady)

### Race Week Taper

**Sprint/Olympic Distance:**
- Monday: Swim 2000m easy
- Tuesday: Run 40 min with 3x5min at race pace
- Wednesday: Bike 60 min with 3x10min race watts
- Thursday: Swim 1500m easy + Run 20 min
- Friday: Rest or 20 min easy swim
- Saturday: 15 min easy bike + 15 min easy run (opener)
- Sunday: RACE

**Half/Full Ironman:**
- Two weeks out: Reduce volume 30%, keep some intensity
- Race week:
  - Monday: Swim 2500m easy
  - Tuesday: Bike 60 min Zone 2
  - Wednesday: Run 40 min easy + 3x3min race pace
  - Thursday: Swim 1500m + Bike 30 min (easy)
  - Friday: Rest
  - Saturday: 20 min easy bike + 20 min easy run (shakeout)
  - Sunday: RACE

## NUTRITION STRATEGY FOR TRIATHLON

### Race Day Nutrition (Critical!)

**Morning of race (3-4 hours before):**
- Familiar, tested breakfast
- 100-150g carbs
- Examples: Oatmeal + banana + honey, Toast + peanut butter + jam
- Avoid: Fiber, fat, unfamiliar foods
- Hydration: 500-750ml water

**30 min before start:**
- Energy gel (25g carbs)
- Few sips of water

**During race:**

**Swim:** Nothing (too hard to eat!)

**Bike:**
- Sprint: Water only
- Olympic: 40-60g carbs per hour (2-3 gels or bars)
- 70.3: 60-90g carbs per hour (mix gels, bars, sports drink)
- Ironman: 80-100g carbs per hour (every 15-20 min, don't wait to feel hungry!)

**Run:**
- Sprint: Water at aid stations
- Olympic: 1-2 gels + water
- 70.3: Gel every 30-40 min + water/electrolytes
- Ironman: Gel every 30-40 min + coke at aid stations (caffeine + sugar boost)

**Hydration:**
- 400-800ml per hour on bike
- Sip at every aid station on run
- If peeing clear = drinking enough

**Sodium:**
- Sprint/Olympic: Not critical
- 70.3: 300-600mg per hour
- Ironman: 500-1000mg per hour (especially if hot)

## INJURY PREVENTION FOR TRIATHLETES

**Common issues:**
1. Swimmer's shoulder → Proper technique + strength training
2. IT band syndrome (runner's knee) → Hip strengthening + rolling
3. Achilles tendinitis → Calf strengthening + gradual volume increase
4. Lower back pain (from bike) → Core work + bike fit check

**Prevention protocol:**
- Strength training 2x per week (focus: core, glutes, shoulders)
- Mobility work daily (10 min)
- Rolling/massage weekly
- Listen to pain signals (sharp pain = stop!)
- Increase volume <10% per week

**Red flags:**
- Pain that worsens during workout
- Pain that persists 2+ days
- Swelling or heat in joint
- Loss of range of motion

→ If any of these, take 2-3 days off and assess

## EQUIPMENT ESSENTIALS

**Swimming:** Wetsuit (if open water), Goggles, Swim cap
**Cycling:** Road or TT bike, Helmet, Cycling shoes, Bottle cages, Nutrition, Cycling computer
**Running:** Running shoes (NOT brand new on race day!), Race belt, Hat, Sunglasses
**Transition:** Towel, Elastic laces, Race belt

## MENTAL PREPARATION

**Visualization:**
- Practice entire race mentally
- See yourself executing perfectly
- Prepare for discomfort (it WILL hurt)

**Race day mantras:**
- Swim: "Smooth and steady"
- Bike: "Save the legs, strong but controlled"
- Run: "Find the rhythm, one mile at a time"
- When it hurts: "This is temporary, embrace the suck"

**Break race into chunks:**
- Don't think about entire race distance
- Focus on next aid station, next mile, next segment
